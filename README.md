Dragon Fruit Image Classification

This project aims to classify dragon fruit images into four categories: Fresh, Wilting, White Spot, and Red Spot, using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on images of dragon fruits collected from different datasets and processed using Keras with TensorFlow.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can automatically classify dragon fruit images based on their condition (Fresh, Wilting, White Spot, or Red Spot). The model is trained and validated on labeled images, with the training dataset being augmented using various image processing techniques to increase model robustness.

Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies dragon fruit images into four categories.
- **Image Augmentation**: Uses techniques like rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping for data augmentation.
- **Model Architecture**: A simple CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.
- **Training**: Model is trained for 25 epochs using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.
  
Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- PIL
- Matplotlib

Dataset

The project uses a dataset of dragon fruit images divided into the following categories:
- **Train**: Contains images used for training the model.
- **Validation**: Contains images used to validate the model.
- **Test**: Contains images used for testing the final model performance.

The dataset is organized into the following folder structure:

```
/Dataset
    /Train
        /Fresh
        /Wilting
        /White Spot
        /Red Spot
    /Validation
        /Fresh
        /Wilting
        /White Spot
        /Red Spot
    /Test
        /Fresh
        /Wilting
        /White Spot
        /Red Spot
```

How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dragon-fruit-classification.git
   cd dragon-fruit-classification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset and place it in the correct directory as described above.

4. Run the Jupyter notebook to start training the model:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Dragon_Fruit.ipynb
   ```

Model Architecture

The model uses a simple CNN structure with the following layers:
- **Conv2D Layer**: 32 filters, kernel size (3,3), ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling2D Layer**: Pool size (2,2)
- **Flatten Layer**
- **Dense Layer**: 64 units, ReLU activation
- **Dense Output Layer**: 4 units (for 4 classes), softmax activation

Results

The model was trained for 25 epochs with an accuracy of around **87%** on the training set. The validation accuracy reached up to **57%**.
